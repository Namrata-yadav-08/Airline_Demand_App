# ✈️ Airline Demand APP (Flask + OpenSky)

A lightweight Flask web application that visualizes airline demand trends using real-time flight data.

The app scrapes flight information from the OpenSky Network, processes it, and displays popular routes, price trends, and demand scores through an interactive dashboard. Users can filter flights by origin, explore route-level insights, and optionally submit data to a mock API endpoint for testing.

The project demonstrates practical use of data scraping, API handling, data visualization, and basic Flask web development in Python.
